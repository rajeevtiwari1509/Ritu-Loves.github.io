# Ritu-Love.github.io
This repository contains a collection of web pages created using HTML, CSS and advanced JavaScript developed as part of my ongoing front-end learning journey under the guidance of Ritu Ma’am. Each page is designed with simple layouts, smooth animations, creative visual effects to improve my understanding of structure, styling, overall web design.
